4. Experience - previous internships and jobs on campus
5. Awards - previous awards
6. Contact - to get in touch with me

**Technologies Used** - HTML, CSS and JavaScript

**Frameworks/Libraries** - React

**React packages used** - 
1. react icons - to use font awesome icons in React
2. react-scroll - to provide the functionality of smooth scrolling within the website when links are clicked
3. react-hook-form - to validate user input in the contact form
4. react-toastify - to provide notification after the form is successfully submitted. Mostly for good UX. After the user has submitted the form, a nice little notification will pop up on the bottom left corner of the screen and will be there for 5 seconds.
